# SSL Admin Task Documentation
My documentation on SSL-admin Task basically has the following steps. you can use specific Links to get to the desired section.

1. [Initial Setup](#stage-1---intial-setup)
2. [Enhanced Security](#enhanced-security)
3. [Firewall and Network security](#firewall-and-network-security)
4. [User and Permission Management](#user-and-permission-management)

## Stage 1 - Intial Setup 
This Stage required me to rent a Cloud VM on Azure or some similar platform.
I was actually new to using such platforms, so it took me some time to understand about them.

I basically signup to Azure Platform and I got about $100 free credits that can be used for over 365 days. I created a static IP resource and a VM using Static IP that I created. Though an easy setup, this took me some time as I was to new to such platform.

Now after setting up VM our first task to enable unattended upgrades for security

Following Commands are used to setup unattended upgrades making sure system always receives latest security upgrades.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
```
<!-- sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades -->
After installing packages we need to make some little changes to config files

```
sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
```
We need to make sure that `` "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security"`` is uncommented.

Also we need to make sure daily updates are enabled, so that updates are run automatically on a schedule. For this make sure that

```
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades 
```

this file has below fields.
```
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
```

And there we go..

The intial setup is finally done üòÆ‚Äçüí®


## Enhanced Security

Usually we use login credentials to get into ssh of some remote pc. But it isn't that much secure. (Brute force can be done basically..)

Here we are implementing a secure way to ssh using public-private key a cryptographic way to secure login.

I got to know concepts regarding this while setting up ssh key to my github, so the stage went quite smoothly..

*Public-Private key is a mechanism where a unique signature made by Private key which can be verified by respective public key.*

- Private key should be kept secret, and public key is used to verify the signature to permit access.

In the context of SSH here we store our private key on our device and while using SSH to get access to remote pc's shell.


### Enable Public-Private Key Auth

1. First we need to create a public-private key pair. this is usually done on our local pc. We can use command ``ssh-keygen`` to create one for us.

2. After Creating a public-private key we need to copy the public key which is stored as .pub file and we need to go to our VM and add it. For this we need to run following commands

    ```
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
    Here we need to paste our public key in a single line.

3. Finally now we can ssh using our stored private key on our device. We can just type the following command to establish a connection for us.
 
    ```
    ssh -i /path_to_private_key username@remote_host_ip
    ```
    This basically verifies the private key on our local pc using saved public key on VM and gives access to shell, kinda more secure than usual login credentials..
    
*After these steps we need to restart our SSH service using systemctl utility.
### Disable Root Login

For this we need to go to SSH daemon config file which is located at ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and change ``PermitRootLogin`` to ``no``.

This basically prevents brute force password attacks on root as its basically well-known username.

### Disable Password Authentication

Similar to root login we need to change the ``PasswordAuthentication`` to ``no`` in the same SSH daemon config file.

But I found an issue with it as i was still able to access SSH through password. After searching through config files found that a file in ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf`` has ``PasswordAuthentication`` set to ``yes`` and the file is included in sshd_config file, which makes me still access SSH using password. 

To completely disable password access to SSH we need to change ``PasswordAuthentication`` in that file to ``no``.

```
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
```

and change 
```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

### Restricting SSH access to specific users 

When i researched about this i came to know that there are actually different ways, but yeah using firewall is a better one of all.

IP are like two types Public and Private. We can eiter allow a public IP are a range of local IP using subnet.

Public IPs are basically globally unique and the router we get connected to access internet has its own public IP and our device will be assigned a Private IP using DHCP (Dynaic Host Control Protocol). 

All our requests inside our Local Area Network are baiscally done using Private IP and the connections outside our Router are handled by Public IP of router by sing something known as NAT (Network Address Translation).

So here as we are outside the Local Network of our cloud VM our SSH request is processed through Public IP whic we can find using ``curl `` 

We can allow requests from that Public IP so only people in the Local Network of that router can access SSH. We can use this to allow all connection through this public IP
```
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.5 to any port 22
sudo ufw delete allow ssh    // To delete our prev rule
sudo ufw reload              // To apply changes
```

To allow range of IP we can just use subnet mask something like 203.0.113.0/24 which basically allows all IPs in range of 203.0.113.1 - 203.0.113.255. (/24 says that 24 bits are like subnet mask and yhh remaining bits can be anything.)


But Yhh Public IP changes sometimes, if the router goes down or due to some other issue.

So, just tried it out once and removed the rule, as i might get locked out if something goes off.

### Fail2ban

Fail2ban is a security tool which protects our VM from brute force attacks.

We need to install fail2ban using ``sudo apt install fail2ban``

THen we need to two copy ``/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`` to ``/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`` file where we make changes. It is done so as to prevent overwriting of .conf file when updates get installed.

In jail.local file under SSH daemon (sshd) section we add the following rules and they are kinda verbose, easy to undestand what they does. 

```
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
```

After that we need to restart fail2ban service.

## Firewall and Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
Uncomplicated Firwall formely ufw is a basically a utility that is designed to simplify the setup and management of firewall rules.


## User and Permission Management

### User Setup

Here to create users we can use ``sudo useradd -m username``. The -m flag automatically creates a home dir for the user and gives rex permisiions to only the user which is sufficient for us.

Btw we can always use `chmod` with sudo to configure permissions if anything goes off. You can always check permissions by using ``ls -lart /home`` and fix up things. 

So to create user exam_1 , exam_2 and exam_3 we need to run these three commands.

```
sudo useradd -m exam_1
sudo useradd -m exam_2
sudo useradd -m exam_3
```

We can also run the following to make sure permissions are correctly configured

```
sudo chmod 700 /home/exam_1
sudo chmod 700 /home/exam_2
sudo chmod 700 /home/exam_3
```

Now we need to create examadmin with sudo permissions using 

```
sudo useradd -m examadmin
sudo usermod -aG sudo examadmin   //adds sudo grp to examadmin
```

You can check groups by using ``groups username``

For examaudit which needs read access to all users home dir we use

```
sudo useradd -m examaudit
sudo usermod -aG exam_1,exam_2,exam_3 examaudit
```
As we added examaudit to all user groups now we can change permissions of grps tohave read access. For that we run the following command.

```
sudo chmod 740 /home/exam_1
sudo chmod 740 /home/exam_2
sudo chmod 740 /home/exam_3
```

By only read access you can only read files whose names are known, but can list or traverse directories. To get those execute permission is needed. For that we need to use

```
sudo chmod 750 /home/exam_1
sudo chmod 750 /home/exam_2
sudo chmod 750 /home/exam_3
```
I used ``sudo passwd username`` to set passwords to all users. For convenience i used password same as username.

Finally, Though our examadmin has root priviliges cd to other user dirs is not possible though we can read and write files for outside directory. But can access those using root shell ``sudo -i``.

If we want examadmin to cd into all user directories without root shell, we can add all user groups to examadmin

```
sudo usermod -aG exam_1,exam_2,exam_3 examadmin
```

### Home Directory Setup

To check permissions, we can use ls -lart /home and check all the permissions, because we already setup these in above steps.

Next to setup Disk Spaces to users
